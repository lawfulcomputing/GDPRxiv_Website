              We analyze GDPRâ€™s enforcement ecosystem in Europe with a goal to
              identify all the sources that generate enforcement information,
              and to design a way to procure this information via automated
              means. The figure depicts (i) the parliaments of EU and member
              states, who pass GDPR regulations/amendments, (ii) the Data
              Protection Authorities (DPAs), who implement the GDPR on the
              ground, (iii) the judicial system that interprets the law, and
              (iv) the EDBP that ensures consistency in GDPR enforcement across
              nations.

          GDPR, via articles 57, 59, and 70, requires DPAs and EDPB to make the
          aforementioned documents available to the public. Though the law does
          not mandate using the Internet as a platform for sharing such data, in
          practice, we have seen all these agencies embrace the electronic
          format and posting content on their websites. Based on this, we have
          compiled the complete set of official sources and links that would
